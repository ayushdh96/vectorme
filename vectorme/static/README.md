# Static Files

This directory contains the frontend files for VectorMe.

## Files

- **index.html** - Main HTML page that loads all dependencies and renders the app
- **styles.css** - All CSS styles for the application
- **app.js** - Main React component (loaded with Babel for JSX transformation)

## Structure

The application is split into three separate files for better maintainability:

1. HTML structure and dependencies (index.html)
2. Styling (styles.css)
3. React component logic (app.js)

All files work together to create the single-page voice recording and diarization application.
