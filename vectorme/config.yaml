# VectorMe Configuration
# TS-VAD (Timestamp-based Voice Activity Detection) and Speaker Diarization Parameters

# TS-VAD refinement parameters
ts_vad:
  # Minimum segment duration in seconds (segments shorter than this are filtered out)
  min_segment_duration: 0.3
  
  # Minimum total audio duration in seconds for a cluster to be considered for speaker identification
  min_cluster_audio: 1.2
  
  # Maximum total audio duration in seconds to concatenate for speaker identification
  max_concat_audio: 12.0
  
  # Cosine similarity threshold for matching speaker embeddings (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Higher values require closer matches to existing speakers
  identify_threshold: 0.5

# VAD (Voice Activity Detection) parameters
vad:
  # Confidence threshold for VAD predictions (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Higher values are more conservative about what is considered speech
  confidence_threshold: 0.5

# Speaker identification and change detection parameters
speaker:
  # Cosine similarity threshold for speaker identification (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Higher values require closer matches to known speakers
  similarity_threshold: 0.3
  
  # Cosine similarity drop threshold for detecting speaker changes (0.0 to 1.0)
  # When similarity drops below this, a speaker change is detected
  change_threshold: 0.7
